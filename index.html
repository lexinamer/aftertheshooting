        <p>The violent murders of three Muslim students, Deah Barakat, Yusor Abu-Salha and Razan Abu-Salha, were a local
          tragedy that sparked a global reaction. Immediately, the #chapelhillshooting caught the world’s attention.
          As students and members of the community we were forced to look deeply at the factors contributing to this
          incident and at the national discourse at play.
          <br><br>Overnight, the small university town of Chapel Hill was transformed. Our liberal-town identity was
          threatened, revealing dark anti-Muslim sentiments. By February 11, one day after the murders, news crews were
          piling up, dozens of vigils were being planned across the world and hashtags such as #muslimlivesmatter and
          #ourthreewinners were trending on social media.
          <br><br>The world had questions. We had questions. How did this happen? And why? The simplified mainstream media
          narrative was not answering them and we grew frustrated.
          <br><br>As students, journalists and members of this community, we felt a responsibility to respond to this event.
           We created this project as a tool for communication, connection and understanding. We analyzed mainstream
           coverage and worked to provide an alternative narrative by curating conversations between members of our own
           community.
           <br><br>America has shown increased government restrictions on religion in recent years and one in three people
           is affected by gun-related incidents. The media driving the discourse surrounding these issues often ignores
           the overlapping complexities.
           <br><br>We hope this project will elevate the conversation, raise critical questions and offer a nuanced
           perspective on this issue, and others like it around the country, which unfortunately happen far too frequently.

<!-- Shooting -->

      <img src="images/theshooting.png" class="headers">
      <p>Hundreds of candle lights flickered at the heart of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
        The mood was somber and dignified. More than two thousand people had gathered to celebrate the lives of the
        three students murdered a day before, on February 10.<br><br>

        Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, Yusor Mohammad and Deah Barakat were Muslim-Americans known in the community for
        their exemplary academic lives, their joy, and kindness. Deah, a dentistry student at UNC-CH, and Yusor, who
        was scheduled to enroll in the fall in the same school, had recently married. Razan, a sophomore at the North
        Carolina State University, was Yusor’s younger sister. The center of campus was packed to the brim with spillover
        into the nearby buildings. People sat on walls and tables and others watched from inside the student union
        holding one another in silence, as friends and family shared stories about Deah, Yusor, and Razan.<br><br>

        At around 5:11pm the day before, Chapel Hill police responded to multiple 911 calls reporting gunshots and screams.
        By the time police arrived at the Finley Forest Condominiums in Chapel Hill, three people were dead, all shot in
        the head. Craig Stephen Hicks, a neighbor, turned himself in to police later that night. He was arrested and
        charged with three counts of first-degree murder. <br><br>

        The shooting sent shockwaves through Chapel Hill, a town known for its tolerance and tranquility. No major
        national television network mentioned the shooting that night and intense frustration over the lack of media
        coverage spread across the globe on social media. The hashtags #chapelhillshooting and  #muslimlivesmatter–an
        allusion to recent protests related to violence against African-Americans–became a worldwide-trend on Twitter
        overnight with more than half a million tweets by the next morning. Many attributed the lack of media coverage
        and Hick’s motive to religious intolerance.<br><br>

        Hours later, Chapel Hill Police released a statement complicating the question of Hicks’ rationale. While it was
        possible the shooting was motivated by hate, the initial investigation led them to believe that the alleged murders
         were related to an “ongoing neighbor dispute over parking,” the statement read.<br><br>

         Within the next 24 hours, two conflicting narratives around the shooter’s motive had emerged: was it a hate crime
         or a parking dispute? It is likely that the question will never be answered. While for family, friends and many
         members of the community it is critical to define the murders as a hate crime, legally it is unlikely that the
         prosecution will try to prove that it was. Hicks could get the maximum punishment–the death penalty–without
         having to proof his rationale to kill. <br><br>

         He is expected to appear in court the first week of April.
