        <p>When there is a tragedy in your own town, it’s different – entirely different.
          <br><br>The execution-style murders of three Muslim students, Deah Barakat, Yusor Abu-Salha and Razan Abu-Salha, were no exception.
          Immediately, the #chapelhillshooting caught the world’s attention.
          <br><br>Overnight, the peaceful, idyllic town of Chapel Hill was transformed.
          No longer could we find comfort behind the walls of our university or cling to our liberal town identity.
          A dark underbelly had been revealed, and it was largely reflective of American anti-Muslim sentiments.
          <br><br>By February 11, just one day after the murders, news crews were piling in by the dozens, hundreds of vigils were being
          planned across the world and hashtags such as #muslimlivesmatter and #ourthreewinners were born.
          <br><br>The world was mourning.
          <br><br>Immediately, our community had questions.  We had questions. How did this happen? And why?
          Yet, the simplified mainstream media narrative was not answering them, and we became frustrated.
          <br><br>As students, as members of this community and as journalists, we became determined to do something about it
          and created this project as tool for communication, connection and understanding.
          We wanted to analyze mainstream coverage, as well as provide an alternative narrative,
          by curating conversations between professionals in our own community.
          <br><br>Our hope is that this project will elevate the conversation around this event, and events like it around the country,
          which unfortunately are happening far too frequently.</p>

      <b>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. &mdash;</b> It was 5:11 p.m. on Tuesday, February 10, when Chapel Hill police responded to multiple 911 calls reporting gunshots and screams. By the time police arrived at the Finley Forest Condominiums in Chapel Hill, three people were dead, all shot in the head. All three, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, Yusor Mohammad and Deah Barakat were Muslim-American students known in the community for their volunteer work. Deah and Yusor had recently married and the Razan was the bride’s younger sister. Both women wore religious headscarves. Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, turned himself in to police on Tuesday night. He was arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder. <br><br>
The shooting reverberated throughout Chapel Hill, a town known for its tolerance and tranquility. No national television network mentioned the shooting on Tuesday and intense frustration over the lack of media coverage spread across the globe on social media overnight. The hashtag #chapelhillshooting became a worldwide-trend  on Twitter only hours after the shooting and was used in more than half a million tweets by Wednesday morning. Many attributed the lack of coverage to the media’s lack of interest in covering the death’s of Muslims.<br><br>

The hashtag #muslimlivesmatter, an allusion to recent protests related to violence against African-Americans, also began trending on Twitter hours after the shooting. The shooter’s motive was unclear, but implicit in much of the speculation on social media was that religion was a factor in the shootings. Many, including one of Deah’s cousins,  explicitly said that the shootings were a hate crime.<br><br>

"Based on the brutal nature of this crime, the past anti-religion statements of the alleged perpetrator, the religious attire of two of the victims and the rising anti-Muslim rhetoric in American society, we urge state and federal law enforcement authorities to quickly address speculation of a possible bias motive in this case," said Council on American–Islamic Relations National Executive Director Nihad Awad.<br><br>
In the next 24 hours, two conflicting narratives around the shooter’s motive had emerged.<br><br>
Chapel Hill Police Chief Chris Blue released a statement complicating the question of Hicks’ motive. While it was possible the shooting was motivated by hate, the initial investigation led police to believe that the alleged murders were related to an “ongoing neighbor dispute over parking,” Blue said. <br><br>
Mohammad Abu-Salha, the father of both female victims, said there was “no doubt that the way they looked and the way they believed” played a role in the murder. “We know from the police that they were shot in the head, very quickly, the three of them, one bullet each, in a very small space inside in the apartment. That's execution-style. I don't know, if that is not hate, what that would be.”<br><br>
In a press conference outside her home, Karen Hicks, Craig Hick’s wife of seven years, dismissed the idea that the shooting was motivated by hate. “This incident had nothing to do with religion or the victims’ faith, but in fact was related to the longstanding parking disputes that my husband had with the neighbors,” she said.<br><br>
On Wednesday evening, more than 2,500 people came together to celebrate the lives of the three murdered students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The heart of campus was packed to the brim with spillover into the nearby buildings. People sat on walls and tables and others watched from inside the student union. The mood was somber and dignified as friends and family spoke on a small stage and shared stories about Deah, Yusor and Razan. A slideshow of images played on a nearby screen. Hundreds of candles glowed during a reading from the Quran. Elected officials and religious leaders urged unity and solidarity. <br><br>
Chapel Hill Mayor Mark Kleinschmidt said, “this community, this university, this town is a welcoming town. It’s a compassionate town. What I believe that we can hold onto, that really I think would be the greatest legacy of our three citizens that we lost, would be to remember who we are and the community that they sustained.”<br><br>
As the vigil came to a close, family and friends gathered near the stage. Many embraces were exchanged and tears flowed. A young boy screamed “but he didn’t do anything!” as he wept on another’s shoulder.<br><br>
It is unlikely the debate over Hicks’ motive will ever be resolved. But to argue that this heinous act stemmed solely from a parking dispute is an over-simplification. Not all parking disputes end in the murder of three people. To accept such a simple narrative is to ignore the identities of both Hicks’ and the three murdered Muslims’.
